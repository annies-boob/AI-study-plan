I found my universities AI courses to be very lacking so I made my own path to learn. This Repository is for my personal learning goals, however if you stumble upon this please feel free to join me and or include suggestions to improve :)

Warning it is very rigorous and I believe that the true way to learn AI is through a bottom up approach with a heavy emphaisis on statistical inference, calculus and linear algebra.

With school as im only in second year I give myself around 3 years to fully get through and understand everything in said learning goals, if you are exceptional you can do it much faster.

All homework assignments from online courses and problems from textbooks should be completed for maximum understanding.

This summer I will also be Auditing cs 898 and 698 at the University Of Waterloo.

And remember the internet is the best university, tons of resources can be found online.




I will eventually get to a section on computer architecture (inspired from googles tpu's that do 256 x 256 matrix multliplication in one clock cycle, Wow!)
